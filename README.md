# LinkedList-Calculator
Use a circular linked list to create and maintain a calculator. New functions can be added, the most recent function can be removed (undo), and the entire list of maintained operations can be returned as a formatted string to view the calculator's 'history'. alternatively, the total() function can be used at any time to view the current total.
